## 💡 Tips for Learning

### Start Small
- Don't read everything at once
- Pick one feature or concept
- Learn it deeply
- Then move to next

### Learn by Doing
- Read a section
- Try the example
- Modify it
- Try again

### Reference as Needed
- Use guides as reference material
- Go back when you have questions
- Keep quick reference handy

### Build Incrementally
- Start with basic workflow
- Add one feature at a time
- Test each step
- Move to advanced patterns
